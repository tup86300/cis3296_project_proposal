    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The AccessAtlas aims to be the central platform for people with accessibility needs to quickly find places that
      accommodate them. The platform, inspired by a past OwlHacks project, will include a searchable list of places
      categorized by the accessibilities they accommodate, an interactive map showing the location of these places, and
      a quick way for users to find directions from their current location. Unlike other platforms that focus on one
      accessibility or on showcasing ratings alone, AccessAtlas aggregates data from many sources, structures it, and
      allows for filtering on many different accessibilities at once. This enables users to confidently find places that
      accommodate them without having to switch between websites and allows it to act as the central platform people go
      to meet their accessibility needs.</p>
